<!-- TODO: NEED to fix the resizing issue with some of the elements (e.g. the text on the landing page).
           Adding width: auto might be the best call for some of these resizing issues. For the text be
           sure to change the font-size to use vw instead of px since vw scales with the view as well as
           making @media screen classes.-->
<!-- TODO: Make the background color gradually change smoothly as you scroll -->
<!-- TODO: Maybe turn some of these elements into their own components (e.g. the picture frame) -->
<!-- TODO: Adjust the swinging animation for the picture frames so they're more smooth -->
<!-- TODO: Remove a lot of the effects and animations at a certain width/height so everything fits -->
<!-- TODO: Maybe add scroll icons to the bottom of the page that handles all the scrolling for the user -->
<!-- TODO: Add the fade in and move up animation to the about me page (use the isElementInView method) -->
